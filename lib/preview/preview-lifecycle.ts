 * injected bridge posts `preview:ready { loadId }` the instant it runs, and the host verifies the
 * loaded document is the one it wrote. If a document never acks (or the frame navigated away to a
 * page that isn't ours), that's an "escape": we try one bounded auto-reload, then surface a
 * recoverable overlay. This class holds the decision logic only — timers, srcdoc writes, and DOM
 * reads live in the component so this stays unit-testable.
